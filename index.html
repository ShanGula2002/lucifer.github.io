            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h5>Competitive <span>& Sociable</span></h5>
            <p>My name is Khyrk shan gula, I am currently studying Bachelor of Science Information System in Itech college.
                 When I was a kid, I love playing outdoor games but when I become a teenagerI found myself in computer shops
                  enjoying playing online games and I promise to myself I will buy my own personal computer with my own money,
                   so that I can play online games whenever I want to. Until I reached Senior High School, I had a job at that time,
                    moderator in an online selling shop and then pandemic strikes. I am partially thanking covid 19 , 
                    because when the covid strikes the NFT grow so fast lucky for me I had a friend on discord who introduce me
                     into that stuff specifically P2E game called Axie Infinity and 2 months go by I finally  bought my personal
                      computer not only I bought a computer but I also renovated our house with my earnings in NFT P2E games then
                       Pegaxy appear, Pegaxy is a P2E game also I was so early to play it, that time the value is so small but after
                        2 or 3 weeks playing it the value of the token in Pegaxy insanely grow up and I made that time a easy 80k in 
                        2 weeks playing it damn. After that the NFT word suddenly went down literally there is no earnings anymore and
                         I decided to continue my college for plan B. But sadly, its hard for me to go back to my past school because
                          I dropped out because I chose to earn money than to study in online class. I am a teacher independent kind of
                           student, and I cant learn through modular thats why I stop my 1st year college in Bago City College as CRIMINOLOGY
                            student. And I found I tech thankfully then accept me even I have bad record in my past school.
                             And now Im just a normal kid. There is no money earning in P2E games anymore, but I do promise myself after
                              I graduate and get a job, I will continue engaging in NFT maybe trading and stuff.</p>
